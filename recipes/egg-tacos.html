    <h1>Easy Egg Tacos (in 5 Minutes!)</h1>
    <img id="recipe-pic" src="../images/egg-tacos.jpg" style="width: 400px; height: auto">
    <h2>You won’t believe the flavor in these fast and easy egg tacos! The vegetarian “taco meat” filling works for any meal of the day.</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>4 eggs</li>
        <li>1/2 tablespoon chili powder</li>
        <li>1/2 tablespoon garlic powder</li>
        <li>1/2 tablespoon cumin</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
        <li>1/2 tablespoon olive oil</li>
        <li>4 taco-sized flour tortillas or corn tortillas</li>
        <li>Pico de gallo or salsa fresca</li>
        <li>1 handful thinly sliced red onion</li>
        <li>Torn cilantro leaves</li>
        <li>Hot sauce</li>
    </ul>
    <ol>
        <li>In a medium bowl, whisk together the 4 eggs. Add the chili powder, garlic powder, cumin, and kosher salt, and whisk until combined.</li>
        <li>In a skillet, heat the olive oil. Add the eggs and cook over medium low heat, scraping as the eggs solidify, about 3 to 4 minutes total. As you scrape, they’ll start to form together into a meat-like texture. Don’t scrape too much or you’ll make too small of pieces: just enough for that it comes together!</li>
        <li>If time, warm and char the tortillas by placing them on an open gas flame on medium for a few seconds per side, flipping with tongs, until they are slightly blackened and warm. (See How to Warm Tortillas.)</li>
        <li>Top with salsa fresca (drain extra liquid before serving), thin sliced red onions, torn cilantro leaves, and hot sauce.</li>
    </ol>
